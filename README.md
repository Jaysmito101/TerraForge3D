# What can this do?

* Tribute to all who **Starred** or **Contributed** to the project
* Procedural Texturing
* Realistic Hydraulic Erosion Simulation (CPU & GPU modes)
* Use custom HDRI Skyboxes
* Water with reflections, ripples, waves.
* OpenCL Support
* Compute Shaders
* Infinite First Person Terrain Explorer
* Maze Generator using Binary Tree Algorithm
* Generte 3D Terrain Procedrally
* First Person Terrain Explorer
* An Highly abstracted API for OpenGL which can be reused by other projects
* Foliage and custom model importer and renderer
* Pack Projects into completely portable `.terr3dpack` files
* A Texture Store Powered By <a href = "https://polyhaven.com/"> PolyHaven </a>
* Export Terrain mesh as OBJ
* Easy and Userfriendly UI
* Autosave and backup projects
* Caching system
* Asset Management
* You can write and test your own shaders
* An Inbuilt IDE for shaders
* Test under different lighting
* A proper 3D viewer
* Sea with waves amd custom color
* Video Tutorials(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl3xhxX__M4A74aaTj8fvqApu7vo3cOiZ">Youtube</a>)
* A Node based as well as Layer based workflow
* Save the project(custom `.terr3d` files)
* Hieght map visualizer in node editor
* Wireframe mode
* Custom Lighiting
* Customizable Geometry Shaders included in rendering pipeline
* Skyboxes
* Multithreded Mesh Generation
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripting to add custom algotrithms
* Export to heightmaps(both PNG and also custom format)
* Custom Skyboxes
* Completely usable 3D procedural modelling and texturing pipeline

# Note

* When you are stating up the app for first time it will need to download some things and cache them you can see the console for deails
* You can Show/Hide the console from Menu > Options > Toggle System Console.
* Whenever you feel that something is wrong or the app is slow check the console for updates

# Contributing

Since this project has become very large I would really love some help.
Here are some things that you might contribute:

* A Documentation (written or video guide)
* Add comments to the source code
* Add the small values here and there to serialization which I may have missed
* Add Some more maze algorithms (like Kruskal's algorithm).(See BinaryTreeMazeNode for reference)
* Report any bug you can find.
* In case you write a general purpose script node in lua you may contribute it if you dont mind.
* You can post the screenshots of your creations to https://github.com/Jaysmito101/TerraGen3D/issues/10

# What of SHOWCASE?

After every 10 - 15 posts in https://github.com/Jaysmito101/TerraGen3D/issues/10 I would make a montage of all of them to show the capabilities of TerraGen3D!

# Support

I am just a Highschool student so I may not have the best quality of code but still i am trying my best to write good code!

Any support would be highly appretiated!

For example you could add a feature and contribute via pull requests or you could even report any issues with the program!

And the best thing you could do to support this project is spread word about this so that more people who might be interested in this may use this!

Please considering tweeting about this!
